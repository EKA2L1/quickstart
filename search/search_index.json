Currently, this is mainly used for bridiging N-Gage local bluetooth multiplayer. This page will instruct you on how to configure and setup multiplayer on EKA2L1 through 2 main modes: LAN and Server . Direct IPs will be mentioned later after the two modes. Open configuration window In this window/view, you can choose Bluetooth netplay mode , and edit some more configuration variables that will be relevant later on. Android Navigate to the top-right three dots button, touch and select Settings . In Settings , choose Bluetooth Netplay . Desktop In the main window, navigate to Bluetooth/Netplay/Configure The configure window appears. Configure for LAN Mechanism LAN mode will allow all players in the same local network, or in more readable language: people in the same house, in the same classroom, connect to the same Internet router, etc... LAN mode will only use IPv4 to broadcast message across all devices on network, asking if any devices that is running on EKA2L1 want to connct to the current device. Other devices that is running EKA2L1 will hear the request, check the secert passphrase, and if it matches, they will respond back with an accept message to the one sending the broadcast. Steps In the configuration window, choose LAN as the bluetooth netplay mode. To allow only some specific people to be able to discover and play with you, set yourself a Password . People with the same Password can see each others, and those that does not have your password will not see you. Send the password to people you want to play with, ask them to copy the password to the Password field/preference in the configuration window. After that, restart the emulator for the change to be effective. On Android, please exit and relaunch the emulator again. Configure for Server Mechanism EKA2L1 instances will login and register itself to the server. When the other instances ask for a scan to find other players, the server will reply back with IPs of people who have the same password as the one who is asking. After that, emulator instances will do P2P with each others. By default, the server address is btnetplay.12z1.com . But since it's developer-powered server that requires money to run, and there's no stable fund, you should consider changing to a community-powered server. Else you can donate to the developers (server cost for now is 5$ a month) :) Steps In the configuration window, choose Server as the bluetooth netplay mode. Configure the network router To make your emulator instance visible to other emulator instances: If you use IPv4 , check if your router has UPnP enabled. If yes, toggle the Enable UPnP option to On . If no, then you need to setup manual port forwarding (also called port mapping). Go to the router control panel, and enable port forwarding for your computer, for these ports: Port 35689 (UDP or TCP/UDP) Port 15000 - 15100 (TCP or TCP/UDP) Example port forward/mapping rules for EKA2L1 on a Huawei router If you use IPv6 : Check if your router has IPv6 firewall enabled. If the answer is yes, exclude these ports from the firewall: Port 35689 (UDP or TCP/UDP) Port 15000 - 15100 (TCP or TCP/UDP) Turning off the firewall completely is not recommended. Note For the port range from 15000 to 15100, these depends on the Port offset value you set. Port offset value should not be changed by normal users, unless you know what it does (the same functionality as in PPSSPP ) For more specific instructions on how to do manual port forwarding or enable UPnP, consider searching the internet for your specific-router or network operators. Note Try to avoid using mobile network like 3G/4G. They don't have control panel to allow port-forwarding or add IPv6 firewall exception. If some mobile operators have control panel then you can try. Configure inside the emulator In the configuration window, choose Server as the bluetooth netplay mode. List of configurations in Server mode on Desktop version To allow only some specific people to be able to discover and play with you, set yourself a Password . People with the same Password can see each others, and those that does not have your password will not see you. Send the password to people you want to play with, ask them to copy the password to the Password field/preference in the configuration window. You can change to another server by editing the Server address configuration. By default the server is btnetplay.12z1.com . After that, restart the emulator for the change to be effective. On Android, please exit and relaunch the emulator again. Configure for Direct IPs Mechanism Direct IPs is a more secertive mode. Each players add IPs of other players you want to play with. Port forwarding or firewall excluding methods, like in Server mode , are required. Steps Visit server mode's Configure the network router section and follow the instructions Visit bluetooth netplay configuration window, switch the mode to Direct IPs On: Desktop : Click on the big Open friends' IP editor button, or visit Bluetooth/Netplay/Friends' IP editor Android : Click on the Direct IPs manager preference in the configuration window Add/remove your friend IPs. Then relaunch the emulator. On Android, you should exit and reopen the emulator again. Changing in-game name To change the in-game name in local bluetooth mode, you need to change the device's Bluetooth name. Android: Click on the three dots, then go to Settings/System . Click on the Friendly device name to change the current name. Windows: Go to File/Preferences/System , and look for a Friendly device name input field. You can change the device name in here, and it will be auto-saved. IPv6 play warnings If you use IPv6 to play online, there will be moment where the temporary IPv6 got released and a new one replaced. When you encounter connection failure, try to reconnect your wifi/internet. Additionally, if you want to play for a while without interruption, try increase the IPv6 lease time .

At the core, it's just a phone running Symbian OS with some exclusive functionalities. This page is intended to laid out the road of getting the emulator running, for those who exclusively want to try out this phone. Obtaining the N-Gage system ROM For those who are used to Nitendo/PlayStation game consoles, consider this ROM as a BIOS. The emulator relies on this to run N-Gage games. If you have an N-Gage , you can dump this ROM yourself. Here is the method: Compile and obtain the Symbian Dumper EXE from Rusty Starship by Raul Tambre Copy the EXE onto your MMC card. Insert the MMC card into the N-Gage. Use a File Explorer like FE Explore or X-plore and copy the EXE to somewhere in the C: drive Run the copied EXE. The ROM, BOOT and ROOT should be dumped in the MMC card. Access the MMC card on computer and obtain only the ROM file. Rename it to SYM.ROM Install N-Gage device from ROM Using the ROM obtained, install the device using the ROM + RPKG method . Note Using this method, you just need to browse to the ROM. For ease, name the ROM as SYM.ROM . If it asked you for RPKG, contact the developer for support. Install N-Gage games N-Gage game files sit on MMC card, unprotected in FAT32 filesystem. There is usually two types of game version you might have access to: Patched games: These games are patched by hacker to bypass DRM. Most of the times they will be very thoughtful to disable multiplayer and N-Gage Arena too, to encourage you to buy the game after trying out the patch. DRM-ed game: These games rely on the presence of a physical MMC card to check for its MMC-ID, to see if the game is contained on a copied-card or not sit on a MMC card at all. The executable of the game is obsfucated so that reverse engineering is harder. Most of N-Gage libraries do this. For Patched games , see install instructions here . For DRM-ed game , in the future, planned AAru support should simplify the play process. But for now, there is no way to install them. See the next section on how to play them. Play DRM-ed N-Gage games EKA2L1 provides some method to simulate the MMC environment. To play authenticate DRM-protected games on the emulator: Edit the MMC-ID to have the same value as on a real MMC-ID card contains the game you want to play. There are some written applications that can do this extraction. Please contact the emulator developers on interest. On Android , open the upper-right menu, and go to Settings/System . Edit the MMC ID setting here. On Desktop , open the config.yml, which is in your current running directory (on Windows , it should be in the same folder as the EXE ). Edit or add the MMC-ID key-value pair. Here is an example: mmc-id : 00000000-00000000-00000000-00000000 Mount the game folder. The root of the game folder should contains a System folder.

Direct IPs will be mentioned later after the two modes. Open configuration window In this window/view, you can choose Bluetooth netplay mode , and edit some more configuration variables that will be relevant later on. Android Navigate to the top-right three dots button, touch and select Settings . In Settings , choose Bluetooth Netplay . Desktop In the main window, navigate to Bluetooth/Netplay/Configure The configure window appears. Configure for LAN Mechanism LAN mode will allow all players in the same local network, or in more readable language: people in the same house, in the same classroom, connect to the same Internet router, etc... LAN mode will only use IPv4 to broadcast message across all devices on network, asking if any devices that is running on EKA2L1 want to connct to the current device. Other devices that is running EKA2L1 will hear the request, check the secert passphrase, and if it matches, they will respond back with an accept message to the one sending the broadcast. Steps In the configuration window, choose LAN as the bluetooth netplay mode. To allow only some specific people to be able to discover and play with you, set yourself a Password . People with the same Password can see each others, and those that does not have your password will not see you. Send the password to people you want to play with, ask them to copy the password to the Password field/preference in the configuration window. After that, restart the emulator for the change to be effective. On Android, please exit and relaunch the emulator again. Configure for Server Mechanism EKA2L1 instances will login and register itself to the server. When the other instances ask for a scan to find other players, the server will reply back with IPs of people who have the same password as the one who is asking. After that, emulator instances will do P2P with each others. By default, the server address is btnetplay.12z1.com . But since it's developer-powered server that requires money to run, and there's no stable fund, you should consider changing to a community-powered server. Else you can donate to the developers (server cost for now is 5$ a month) :) Steps In the configuration window, choose Server as the bluetooth netplay mode. Configure the network router To make your emulator instance visible to other emulator instances: If you use IPv4 , check if your router has UPnP enabled. If yes, toggle the Enable UPnP option to On . If no, then you need to setup manual port forwarding (also called port mapping). Go to the router control panel, and enable port forwarding for your computer, for these ports: Port 35689 (UDP or TCP/UDP) Port 15000 - 15100 (TCP or TCP/UDP) Example port forward/mapping rules for EKA2L1 on a Huawei router If you use IPv6 : Check if your router has IPv6 firewall enabled. If the answer is yes, exclude these ports from the firewall: Port 35689 (UDP or TCP/UDP) Port 15000 - 15100 (TCP or TCP/UDP) Turning off the firewall completely is not recommended. Note For the port range from 15000 to 15100, these depends on the Port offset value you set. Port offset value should not be changed by normal users, unless you know what it does (the same functionality as in PPSSPP ) For more specific instructions on how to do manual port forwarding or enable UPnP, consider searching the internet for your specific-router or network operators. Note Try to avoid using mobile network like 3G/4G. They don't have control panel to allow port-forwarding or add IPv6 firewall exception. If some mobile operators have control panel then you can try.

Note The support of running J2ME applications on EKA2L1 comes off as just-for-fun. If you want to play J2ME games with more customization, check out KEmulator on desktop, or J2ME-Loader on Android Supported emulated devices EKA2L1 tries to utilise the J2ME runners on ROM of installed devices. Currently, devices that ran these OS versions can be used to run J2ME applications on emulator: Series 60 version 1 (S60v1) Due to the complexity of the J2ME system, OS version starting from Series 60 version 2 (S60v2) has not been supported. The priority of working on the support is low. Supported MIDP versions The emulator will only accept J2ME with the following MIDP versions (declared in MANIFEST.MF): MIDP 1.0 This is due to the fact that S60v1 J2ME runner only support MIDP 1.0. Install and play JARs 1. Make sure you have switched to an S60v1 device. 2. Click on the File menu, and then navigate to Install/JAR . Click and choose JAR file you want to install. For example, in the image above, you can see N-Gage device being choosen in the right-hand combo box. And File/Install/JAR menu is displayed. A dialog will appear after telling you if the installation is success or encountered error. The error message should be straight forward to understand. If you encountered the error that the JAR can not be installed on the current device, check if your current active device (see the device combobox next to the search bar, at the upper of the app grid) is a S60v1 device or not 3. After the installation finished, next to the device list combo-box next to the app search bar, you will see a button. If its name is Symbian , that means the app list is in native Symbian mode. It will only display native applications and games, that is commonly installed through the SIS/SISX format. If its name is J2ME , the app list grid will switch to J2ME mode, which will display only J2ME game. App list in Symbian mode, which displays native game. The image above shows the native application list in action. The button being circled and arrow-pointed is naming the current application list mode. To switch to J2ME mode , press on that same button. The app list is now in J2ME mode. Native applications are not in display anymore. To switch back to Symbian mode , press on that same button again. Toggle the button will switch between the two modes. FAQs Q: I have installed the JARs successfully, but when I come back and launch them, the emulator says Can't open the application! . How to fix it? A: You should first check if you are using the correct device to play those J2ME games. For now, only S60v1 devices are supported, so make sure the current device is S60v1. Q: The game is MIDP-1.0 but they still does not work on emulator! A: Some games depend on different vendor's APIs or simply just missing some kind of API that S60v1 J2ME runner does not provide.

At the core, it's just a phone running Symbian OS with some exclusive functionalities. This page is intended to laid out the road of getting the emulator running, for those who exclusively want to try out this phone. Obtaining the N-Gage system ROM For those who are used to Nitendo/PlayStation game consoles, consider this ROM as a BIOS. The emulator relies on this to run N-Gage games. If you have an N-Gage , you can dump this ROM yourself. Here is the method: Compile and obtain the Symbian Dumper EXE from Rusty Starship by Raul Tambre Copy the EXE onto your MMC card. Insert the MMC card into the N-Gage. Use a File Explorer like FE Explore or X-plore and copy the EXE to somewhere in the C: drive Run the copied EXE. The ROM, BOOT and ROOT should be dumped in the MMC card. Access the MMC card on computer and obtain only the ROM file. Rename it to SYM.ROM Install N-Gage device from ROM Using the ROM obtained, install the device using the ROM + RPKG method . Note Using this method, you just need to browse to the ROM. For ease, name the ROM as SYM.ROM . If it asked you for RPKG, contact the developer for support. Install N-Gage games N-Gage game files sit on MMC card, unprotected in FAT32 filesystem. There is usually two types of game version you might have access to: Patched games: These games are patched by hacker to bypass DRM. Most of the times they will be very thoughtful to disable multiplayer and N-Gage Arena too, to encourage you to buy the game after trying out the patch. DRM-ed game: These games rely on the presence of a physical MMC card to check for its MMC-ID, to see if the game is contained on a copied-card or not sit on a MMC card at all. The executable of the game is obsfucated so that reverse engineering is harder. Most of N-Gage libraries do this. For Patched games , see install instructions here . For DRM-ed game , in the future, planned AAru support should simplify the play process. But for now, there is no way to install them. See the next section on how to play them. Play DRM-ed N-Gage games EKA2L1 provides some method to simulate the MMC environment. To play authenticate DRM-protected games on the emulator: Edit the MMC-ID to have the same value as on a real MMC-ID card contains the game you want to play. There are some written applications that can do this extraction. Please contact the emulator developers on interest. On Android , open the upper-right menu, and go to Settings/System . Edit the MMC ID setting here. On Desktop , open the config.yml, which is in your current running directory (on Windows , it should be in the same folder as the EXE ). Edit or add the MMC-ID key-value pair. Here is an example: mmc-id : 00000000-00000000-00000000-00000000 Mount the game folder. The root of the game folder should contains a System folder.

S60v1 devices should only need the ROM for this installation method. Firmware method S60v3 devices and higher (S60v5, S^3, Belle, ...). These firmware are distributed widely, so they are easier to obtain then ROM+RPKG. Required files For S60v1 and S60v2 devices (N-Gage, N70, etc...) The ROM of the device The RPKG file This is a custom container of the Z drive (the same device as where the ROM was dumped). See Dumping section on Wiki to find out how to dump it. The file may only be needed with S60v2 devices. The emulator will asks for it during the installation if it detects only ROM alone is not enough. For S60v3 and upper (5320, 5800, N97, N-Gage 2.0 compatible devices, etc...) There are two options that you can choose: ROM and RPKG of the device (same as S60v1 and S60v2) A firmware of the target device. Make sure the firmware you got also has a VPL file along with it. At the moment, for users only interested in N-Gage 2.0, Nokia 5320 device is the most maintained and supported device for this purpose. Install steps for PC (Windows, MacOS, Linux) Launch the emulator with command line option --help if you want to interact through command lines and need list of commands. To install a new device, please go to File/Install/Device , or follow the dialog that ask you to install a device appears on first run of the emulator. The device install dialog Install by ROM and RPKG Choose the Device dump installation method in the combo-box, and click the first Browse to select the ROM you have prepared. If the emulator detects that the ROM is not enough alone, a RPKG file browser will appear. The RPKG field appears with 5320 ROM selected After you have filled all the paths, press Install . If you want to cancel the installation, you can press the Cancel button next to Install . Then wait for the progress bar to be completed and a success dialog to pop up. Install by firmware Choose the Firmware (VPL) installation method in the combo-box. The ROM label will be renamed to VPL, and then you can click Browse to choose the VPL that came along with the firmware. The VPL install dialog A dialog should appear request you to choose a firmware variant. This usually is related to region of the device and its style (black or red), and should not matter much on the emulator. After that is the same process as Device dump . Installation success dialog If you meets the dialog above, then that means you are done installing a device. Install steps for Android First run of the emulator should show you a dialog that requests you to install a device. Press the Install dialog, to quickly get to the Device manager .

The ROM button will be renamed to VPL, and then you can click on the VPL button to choose the VPL that came along with the firmware. All file paths are filled After you have filled all the paths, press Install . You can only cancel this operation by exiting the app, and no need further action until a small toast notification tells you that the installation is success or encounters failures.
