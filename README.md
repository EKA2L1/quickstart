## For translators :D

- In quickstart/docs folder, translate all **en.md** file and make a new file with the extension **<language_code>.md**. For example, if you translate **eat.en.md** to Russia, new file should be **eat.ru.md**.

Additionally, please add your language in:
- quickstart/mkdocs.yml file

Thanks a lot for your consideration.
