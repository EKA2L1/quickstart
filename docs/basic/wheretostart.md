# Where to start

You just found out the emulator and want to play games or launch apps you have used before, but clueless on where to start. Here is a navigation page that should answer your questions.

## N-Gage users

The majority of crowd who comes to here want to try out the N-Gage or re-experience it. There's a dedicated [N-Gage](/{{ posts_root }}/ngage) page for you to get started.

## N-Gage (2.0) users

Unlike the N-Gage, **N-Gage 2.0** is actually a **game service**, that is ran on a normal Nokia phones like N95, 5320 Express Music, N82, ... Those devices are powered by Symbian OS like the original N-Gage too, just that those phone use a much more morden version of the OS (S60v3 phones).

People are often confused on how to install this service, so there is too a page dedicated to [N-Gage (2.0)](/{{ posts_root }}/ngage2).

## I'm an experienced Symbian users. But I still don't know what to do

**EKA2L1** needs files from a real phone to emulate that phone's operating system and UI. So first of all, you need to install a device's files, or in **EKA2L1**, we call it *install a device*.

Head to the [Install a device](/{{ posts_root }}/basic/installdevice) page first to get started. Then you can go to [Install apps](/{{ posts_root }}/basic/installapp) page to install your apps/games and get going!
